If you're interested in copying the CSV visualizer, be my guest!
You need `books.html`, `books.js` and the `fonts`.
The "CSV" is just within the `books.js` file, I know that's bad but you know what's worse? To have to edit a CSV file everytime you want to update something to your table, trust me.

git add -A
git commit -m "Some change"
git push origin master   # or main

then

npm run deploy
