So, I decided to end this pink beauty to the detriment of a very boring HTML website.

I'm in this vibe of documenting everything in my life, so this blog post is an attempt to have the history of my website stored somewhere in the clouds.

Here is is the main page with the iconic footer floating in the middle of the screen problem that happens in some screens that I know of for about 4 years but haven't done nothing since.

My projects page:

And the cute but cringy about me:

Let's see how long I can stand a super boring website.

Hopefully this motivates me to create something beautiful out of my Pinterest folder of ideas.
