            Hello! Are you interested in being a mentor for Women of Color Code, ReDI Berlin, Open Life Science or PyLadies Berlin community and have questions about it? Check this <a class="link-secondary" href="https://psychonautgirl.space/#injustice">link</a> and feel free to <a class="link-secondary" href="https://psychonautgirl.space/#social">contact</a> me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Are you a member of one of these communities and would like to schedule a slot with me? Please try to use this <a class="link-secondary" href="https://calendar.app.google/3fY8FVyijHZguXao8"></a>link, if none of these time work for you, feel free to shoot me a message and we can figure something out!
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought it'd be useful to come up with a list of things I can do for people. The mentoring is not restricted to these things, feel free to come up with your own needs and ideas, this is just to help you to think on things where I could be useful to you:
            <ul>
                <li>help you to write a cover letter for a job</li>
                <li> build a linkedin profile</li>
                <li> build a resume</li>
                <li> build a personal website</li>
                <li> help you to prepare for software engineer related job interview</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> conduct mock interviews</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li> I can pretend to interview you! I'll use the <a class="link-secondary" href="https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf">STAR</a> method to ask general questions. I can also prepare a code challange one if you wish (but these are really stressfull and annoying, so no stress if you don't want to do them)</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                <li> can help you with a specific software topic on a session, check my main website and github if you're in doubt on what kinds of things I can mentor you on</li>
                <li> help you to set goals and keep you on track to achieve your goals</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> as in have regular check-ins to see how you're doing and what do you need to keep going</li>
                        <li> or just change to a new goal because your current goal doesn't ressonate with you anymore</li>
                    </ul>
                <li> coworking together</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> we can meetup in berlin and cowork together. The idea for this is not that i'm following you in every step, but that we're coworking side by side and I can help you any time you're stuck</li>
                        <li> I work with open source and if you're interested I can show you how to contribute to open source to my project, check <a class="link-secondary" href="https://pyscript.net">pyscript.net</a> for the general idea and for the code <a class="link-secondary" href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript">github.com/pyscript/pyscript</a></li>
                        <li> if you're not in Berlin we can try something online, just book a session!</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
