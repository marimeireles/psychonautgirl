        <b><p>Hello beings of the universe,</p></b>

        <p>My name is Mariana Meireles[she/her]. Welcome to my professional website with sprinkles of personal me.</p>

        <p>I mostly write scientific software @<a class="link-secondary" href="https://quantstack.net/">QuantStack</a>. Known as software engineer, but I'm a bit of code archeologist, librarian and janitor. I work with C++ and Python most of the time, but I've seen some dark sides of Typescript too. My team and I are all around the <a class="link-secondary" href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> ecosystem and we're a consultancy, so if you're interested in our work, feel free to <a class="link-secondary" href="mailto:marianameireles@quantstack.net">get in touch!</a></p>

        <p>I'm interested in Rust and the design choices made in the language. I'm also curious about deeplearning things and spend part of my free time looking into this stuff. I really like to understand things to their last bit, and reverse engineer all of them until they stop being magical monuments. I have an non exhaustive list of <a class="link-secondary" href="https://github.com/cyborgdream/cyborgdream.github.io#readme">WIPs and Wishes</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm a person driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in the idea behind open source and the internet and I love to work with it. It deeply resonates with very different aspects of my personality and I have this hope to make the digital world accessible and comfortable for all.</p>

        <p>If you're a recruiter looking to get in touch with me please check the requisites and have a sit on the <a class="link-secondary" href="https://e7a1xatfr0q.typeform.com/to/ScImy663">waiting room</a>. I'll come talk to you as soon as I can.</p>

        <p>Feel free to look around.</p>

        <a class="link-dark" href="#community"><h3 id="community">Community</h3></a>

        <p>I found out the way I learn the best is by having the support of a community. Do you want to learn something together? Just shoot me a message with your availability and what you'd like to tackle together.</p>

        <ul>* Touch designer, Houdini -> for projection mapping and generative art.</ul>
        <ul>* Rust -> All kinds of stuff, do you want a contributor to your project? Or you want to do something with me? Check <a class="link-dark" href="https://github.com/cyborgdream/cyborgdream.github.io#readme">here</a> to learn what I'm up to.</ul>
        <ul>* C++ -> I'm always trying to learn more C++ because the complexity on this language is fractal! I kind of help to organize a meetup about it (that's in Berlin but went online), we can work on that. We can also just learn random stuff together and talk about it, check what <a class="link-dark" href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/c/">I've been up to</a> lately.</ul>
        <ul>* Drawing -> I'm a beginner tattoo artist and I still have a long way to go! I know the basics of painting with spray and we can think about mural projects or just tagging random places too. I'm also interested in improving watercolor and general drawing. I'm also following the Draw a Box.</ul>
        <ul>* Competitive programming -> I'm planning to start this study group on Pyladies Berlin, you're welcome to help me lead (all genders welcome!).</ul>
        <ul>* Music -> Music theory, music producing (mainly electronic but also interested in analog jams), djing, foxdot and this kind of shananigans.</ul>
        <ul>* Flow -> Dance, poi, hula-hoop, fire flow, meditation, yoga. Anything flowey, I'm always looking for people to share practices with.</ul>
        <ul>* Security -> I have this notion that I should know security.</ul>
        <ul>* Compilers -> !</ul>

        <h3>Social injustice fighting</h3>

        <p>How can you make a difference?</p>

        <ul>* <a class="link-dark" href="https://www.redi-school.org/">ReDI</a>: In response to the refugee crisis the ReDI School was founded: a vocational training program teaching digital skills to migrants and locals. If you're a software engineer, you can help!</ul>

        <ul>* <a class="link-dark" href="https://www.frauenloop.org/">Frauen Loop</a>: FrauenLoop offers a diverse network of women tech professionals who train motivated, women-identified persons in computer programming. They're also looking for teachers.</ul>

        <p>Abortions:</p>
        <p>For absurd legal reasons, doctors in Germany are not allowed to post factual information on abortions on their websites. Other websites are allowed to post this information, though. <a class="link-dark" href="https://fragdenstaat.de/aktionen/219a/">Frag Den Staat</a> is currently providing resources on the subject in German, English and Turkish.</p>
