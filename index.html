                  <p>I’m a coordination and emergent algorithms independent researcher. Using the concepts drawn from these fields as a base, I’m interested in using my software skills to raise awareness to the issues that crumble our institutions and in ensuring that the development of our moral foundations surpasses our technological development.</p>

                  <p>As an active member of the open-source community, I engage with NumFOCUS in various capacities: as a distinguished Jupyter contributor, a Jupyter Widgets steering council member, and a participant in the NumFOCUS DISC committee. Additionally, I help people develop their software skills through WoCCode and PyLadies Berlin. In the past, I have mentored coders and scientists in initiatives like Open Life Science and the ReDi project.</p>
                  <p>As an open science ecosystem contributor, I have served as a subject matter expert for NASA, developing a course aimed at providing guidance for scientists on practicing open science. I've also taught classes at Harvard through the LSSTC-DSFP program and at several other conferences and meetups.</p>

                  <p>If you're a tech recruiter, please answer these <a href="https://e7a1xatfr0q.typeform.com/to/ScImy663">two quick questions</a> before getting in touch with me.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="research" class="tab-pane fade container paragraph" role="tabpanel">
                  <a>emergent algorithms:</a>
                  <p>I'm studying reinforcement learning, agent based modeling, causal inference and game theory. The scenarios you can model with these technologies combined are vast. Currently, I'm especially interested in the modeling of institutions in order to understand how agents cooperate or not within different systems and cooperative AI, which is a branch of AI alignment. I've recently started a <a href="https://techforgoodresearch.substack.com/">research blog</a> where I explain my understanding of these concepts and sometimes come up with new science!</p>
                  <p>I also write some unstructured notes <a href="https://marimeireles.notion.site/Complexity-and-coordination-15814d5b41874928b08506a55c92fc61?pvs=4">here</a>.</p>
                  <a>poverty alleviation:</a>
                  <p>I'm currently enrolled in MIT's MicroMasters Program in Data, Economics, and Development Policy and I hope to gain a better understanding of poverty alleviation. This knowledge could hopefully be employed in my interests about modeling institutions using emergent algorithms, but I also believe it will be beneficial to my side projects like permaculture to Brazil's no land movement and the development of open-source internships to people coming from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
                  <a>open knowledge:</a>
                  <p>I'm driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in the open/libre internet. Liberating knowledge and fostering cultural and scientific development deeply resonates with many of my personal principles and working towards making the digital world more accessible and comfortable for all is a very fulfilling mission to me.</p>
                  <p>My main form of action on this front has been the advocacy of both the ethos and the practice of open source and open science. Highlights about my work <a href="https://marimeireles.com/resume-partial.html">here</a>.</p>
                  <a>governance:</a>
                  <p>With the intent of creating resilient communities, I'm interested in driving research that allows for both quantitative and qualitative forms of assessing different kinds of governance systems. Initially, I'm focusing on open source communities and possibly expanding to real-life communities.</p>
                  <p>I have helped shape several open source communities in the past. Currently, I'm helping to write the NumFOCUS Cookbook. In case you're interested/curious, I have some links and comments <a href="https://marimeireles.notion.site/Governance-and-open-source-63235d5f677448cfb411db8dbed19fc4?pvs=4">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>After having an incredible experience living in <a href="https://wireless-hippie.github.io/martian/">Mars College</a>, I've decided for good that "happiness is only real when shared". I'm looking for a commune to live in. Do you know of anything? I'll be letting go of my really cheap and cozy apartment in Berlin if you're looking for a place to stay. If you want to get to know me better, use a slot from <a href="https://calendar.app.google/8YGJwftf7mbHwp6t5">here</a>.

                  <p>I found out the way I learn the best is by having the support of a community. Do you want to learn something together? Send me a message! I invite you to take a look at <a href="https://marimeireles.notion.site/ba473e6b20464b63bb6417a3d5e284c0?v=fd6def1276a9491eb766811161ed7ed9&pvs=4">my current list</a> of software projects to see if we have a matching one. But I'm also curious about what you have in mind! Besides writing software, I'm interested in many other things, check the list below!</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Books</b>: I love reading and discussing things I learn. Do you want to read together? Check my <a href="https://marimeireles.com/books.html">reading list</a>, maybe we can chill in a cafe or park and share our thoughts after a reading sesh.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Light installation and vjing</b>: I really love to be the girl taking care of lights at events. I've built my own DMX controller, for example, and I'm somewhat versed in being a scrappy electronics person. I also try to be artsy with Touch Designer, I mainly focus on interactive art. Check some of my <a href="https://github.com/marimeireles/touchdesigner-toes/tree/master">toes</a>. Here's a link for a portfolio I'm building. I'm always open for hire and collaborations to do this kind of work.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Drawing</b>: I'm a <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/marimeireles/gallery">beginner tattoo artist</a>. I tattoo myself and friends. To me, this is a very special ritual and one of the few sacred things in my atheist existence. If you feel like it, email me and I might tattoo you! I know the basics of painting with spray, and I want to learn more, I would very much like to learn together. I also want to improve in watercolor and drawing, for that I love to go out on small friend dates and paint in the park.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>AI art*</b>: Back in the day, I've experimented with GANs and created some -I like to think- cool tattoo designs. The link for the notebook is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hcUHPLk98zN_V89Z0U5nMUhabPjWk05k?userstoinvite=zeynepsatir35%40gmail.com&actionButton=1">here</a>, but I doubt it still works. Nowadays, I'm marginally interested in doing something beautiful and long playing with Stability-like things but haven't started yet. Would love to collaborate with my software skills if any artists have a vision.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Programming languages</b>: Sometimes I geek out on computer languages and try to understand them deeply. I write about <a href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/rust/">Rust</a> (👼 baby level), <a href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/cpp/">C++</a> and <a href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/python/">Python</a>. I'm also part of a women-only C++ work group in Berlin, you can learn more about it <a href="https://dynamic-cast.github.io/"> here</a>.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Music</b>: Music theory, music producing (mainly electronic but also interested in analog jams), djing, foxdot(and similar shenanigans). I play the guitar and sing a bit, trying to be better at my Bossa Nova practicing. Looking for motivated people to practice with.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Flow</b>: Poi, hula-hoop, fire flow, yoga. Anything flowey, I'm always looking for people to share these practices with.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Buddhism</b>: I practice Tibetan Buddhism. I'm really interested in several of its concepts, from meditation to the embodiment of great yidams to the beautiful ceremonies and practices. I'm part of an <a href="https://aroencyclopaedia.org/shared/text/i/information_in_01_introduction_eng.php">Aro</a> sangha in Berlin and you're welcome to join us if you're interested and respectful. I'm not religious myself, but thankfully this branch is extremely permissive. I'm also curious to explore different branches of Vajrayana.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Climbing</b>: I practice every other day in a gym in Berlin. If you're also a climber, let's meet up someday and climb together!</li>
                    <br>
                  </ul>
