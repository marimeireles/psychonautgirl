                  <p>I strive to live poetically and fearlessly.</p>
                  <p>In my work, that means compassionately applying my efforts to improve the world for people.</p>
                  <p>Previously, I worked with software in the open-source and open-science ecosystems, contributing to projects like Firefox, Jupyter Notebooks, and Conda.</p>
                  <p>Now, in an effort to better reconcile my pursuit of "the good" with my particular set of interests and passions, I'm working as a researcher, and I really enjoy it! I currently work at CHAI at UC Berkeley.</p>

                  <a>Somewhat outdated: </a>
                  <p>I'm seeking opportunities to work with organizations that are uplifting to the world.</p>
                  <p>I've worked as a software engineer with a focus on scientific development for several years. All of this work was within open-source organizations. As a Systems Engineer, I mostly focused in backend and devops work, developing libraries for other developers and scientists. I'm a core contributor to projects such as Jupyter, Firefox, Mamba, Conda Forge, Farama's Zoo, PyScript,  PySide, Mozilla Webcompat, Qt, and others.</p>
                  <p>Currently I'm affiliated with the Open Knowledge Foundation as an Expert.</p>
                  <p>In the past, I served as a member of the Jupyter technical committee, as a member of the DISC NumFOCUS steering committee, as a Max Planck Insitute Open Science Ambassator and as a Subject Matter Expert for NASA, developing a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/new-course-from-nasa-helps-build-open-inclusive-science-community/">course</a> aimed at providing guidance for scientists on practicing open science.</p>
                  <p>I've also taught open science and software classes to graduate students at Harvard through the LSSTC-DSFP program and at <a href="http://github.com/marimeireles/talks">several other</a> conferences, meetups, and groups. I'm also grateful for the Jupyter community having recognized me as a <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/congratulations-distinguished-contributors-bc349fa60d68">distinguished contributor</a> in early 2022.</p>
                  <p>Communicating ideas is important, I write about software in my personal blog <a href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/">"Do Cyborgs Dream of Bionic Sheep?"</a> and on my <a href="https://medium.com/@mari-meir">Medium</a> page.</p>
                  <p>You can access my talks, workshops, classes, and podcasts at this <a href="https://github.com/marimeireles/talks/">link</a> and check out my hack projects that I tackle alone or with friends <a href="https://marimeireles.notion.site/ba473e6b20464b63bb6417a3d5e284c0?v=fd6def1276a9491eb766811161ed7ed9&pvs=4">here</a>.</p>

                  <a>coordination:</a>
                  <p> As a Cooperative AI researcher I'm interested in understanding what are the underlying characteristics that are important for fostering cooperation among heterogeneous actors.</p>
                  <p>The reason why I care about furthering this area of research is because I believe it can directly improve people's lives, be it in increasing cooperation between political and economic agents or in improving coordination among humans and machines.</p>
                  <p>In <a href="https://wbarfuss.github.io/">BarfussLab</a>, I'm modeling the interaction of heterogeneous agents in repeated general-sum game scenarios using reinforcement learning. If you are interested in the overall direction of the research take a look at our recent poster <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a3Dc969Lc4xaHohcjnDenScpFtLa842JdTFG2QPSZO8/edit?ouid=105696229270990730563&usp=slides_home&ths=true">Learning to cooperate with intelligence inequality: a complexity science exploration</a>.</p> 
                  <p>I have a <a href="https://techforgoodresearch.substack.com/">research blog</a> where I write about my experiments.</p>
                  <a>poverty alleviation:</a>
                  <p>One of the main goals of my work in coordination is to be able to better coordinate markets in a way that benefits people living in extreme poverty. <a href="https://marimeireles.notion.site/Research-plans-2024-b798b8bd7538430697e6bb568b03738b?pvs=4">Some initial thoughts</a> are described here but they need to be expanded.</p>
                  <p>I've started a non-profit for people in developing countries to connect with the global open source ecosystems. Journey offers 3 months long paid programming projects under the guidance of experienced software mentors. Learn more about it at <a href="https://opensourcejourney.org/">opensourcejourney.org</a>.</p>
                  <p>I'm currently enrolled in MIT's MicroMasters Program in Data, Economics, and Development Policy because I hope to gain a better understanding on how to be more effective about supporting and developing poverty alleviation policies.
                  I care about support people from unprivileged backgrounds by having a fitting <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Pedagogical-ethos-for-kids-impacted-with-poverty-aacad2d96f3c422199524255878b2f07?pvs=4" target="_blank">pedagogical ethos</a> to their contexts, <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Familiar-permaculture-project-Brazil-0277fccccb7740c49cc0845b824e9d10?pvs=4" target="_blank">teaching farmers about permaculture and supporting them with community and grants</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Increasing-internet-access-b377c40a21ba483ebec686afc0a508c5?pvs=4" target="_blank">increasing internet access in the world</a>.</p>
                  <a>open knowledge:</a>
                  <p>I find a lot of significance and love in the open/libre internet. Liberating knowledge and fostering cultural and scientific development deeply resonates with many of my personal principles and working towards making the digital world more accessible and comfortable for all is a very fulfilling mission to me.</p>
                  <p>My main form of action on this front has been the advocacy of both the ethos and the practice of open source and open science.</p>
                  <p>2024 update: I'm now highly uncertain about the advantages of open-licensing everywhere. I'm still very much pro-open access manifesto, but this doesn't comprise AI technologies.</p>
                  <a>governance:</a>
                  <p>Increasing interoperability and people's agency in a world of machines and humans. I keep some notes <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Governance-and-open-source-63235d5f677448cfb411db8dbed19fc4">here</a>.</p>

                  <p>I'm uncertain about this, but always interested in discussing.</p>

                    <br>
                    <li><b>Buddhism and meditation</b>: I practice Dzogchen Tibetan Buddhism. That said, I was a part of many religious traditions in the past and I enjoy very much learning about all kinds of different cults and spiritual communities. I'm part of an <a href="https://aroencyclopaedia.org/shared/text/i/information_in_01_introduction_eng.php">Aro</a> sangha in Berlin and you're welcome to join us if you're interested and respectful, the sangha is religious. I'm interested in meditating with others and sharing curious states of consciousness (non-related with drug-usage as I do my best to follow the <a href="https://www.parallax.org/mindfulnessbell/article/dharma-talk-five-wonderful-precepts/">five precepts</a>).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Literature</b>: I really enjoy learning through reading and exploring new worlds through text. I try to keep an up-to-date <a href="https://marimeireles.com/books.html">reading list</a>, maybe we can chill in a cafe or park and talk about ideas we had after reading together. I also write or post short texts or poems I like <a href="https://lettersfortheevanescents.mataroa.blog/">here</a>.</li>

                    <li><b>Drawing</b>: I'm a <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/marimeireles/gallery">beginner tattoo artist</a>. Tattoing is a very special practice to me, something I consider truly sacred and ritualistic. I'm open to tattooing new people, if you're interested, send me an email. I'm looking to get a Sak Yant done, please let me know if you know anyone in Europe or the US that is able to bless it. I tattoo myself and friends. I also know the basics of painting with spray, and I want to learn more, I would very much like to learn together. I also want to improve in watercolor and drawing, for that I like to go out on small friend dates and paint city/landscapes.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>AI Art*</b>: In the past, I've experimented with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hcUHPLk98zN_V89Z0U5nMUhabPjWk05k?userstoinvite=zeynepsatir35%40gmail.com&actionButton=1">GANs</a> and created some <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/marimeireles/gallery/82011542/gan-designs-2021">cool tattoo designs</a>.
