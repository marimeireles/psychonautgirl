        <b><p>Hello beings of the universe, üëΩüññ</p></b>

        <p>My name is Mariana Meireles[she/her]. Welcome to my professional website with sprinkles of personal me üç©.</p>

        <p>During the week, I mostly write scientific software @<a href="https://quantstack.net/">QuantStack</a>. Known as software engineer, but I'm a bit of code archeologist, librarian and janitor. I work with C++ and Python most of the time, but I've seen some dark sides of Typescript too. My team and I are all around the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> ecosystem and we're a consultancy, so if you're interested in our work, feel free to <a href="mailto:marianameireles@quantstack.net">get in touch!</a> ‚ú®</p>

        <p><b>About my cyber-tech side:</b> I'm interested in Rust and the design choices made in the language. I'm also curious about deeplearning things and spend part of my free time looking into this stuff. I really like to understand things to their last bit, and reverse engineer all of them until they stop being magical monuments. I have an non exhaustive list of <a href="https://github.com/cyborgdream/cyborgdream.github.io#readme">WIPs and Wishes</a>.</p>

        <p><b>About my tech-soul side:</b> I'm a person driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in the idea behind open source and the internet and I love to work with it. It deeply resonates with very different aspects of my personality and I have this hope to make the digital world accessible and comfortable for all.</p>

        <p>When I'm not writing code I'm (ideally) appreciating nature and my community, working on my awareness, playing music or scribbling.</p>

        <p>I'm often traveling and my time zones may vary.</p>

        <p>If you're a recruiter looking to get in touch with me please check the requisites and have a sit on the <a href="https://e7a1xatfr0q.typeform.com/to/ScImy663">waiting room</a>. I'll come talk to you as soon as I can.</p>

        <a href="#community"><b id="community">Community</b></a>

        <p>I found out the way I learn the best is by having the support of a community. Do you want to learn something together? I'm always doing lots of things but I'll make time to meet you, just shoot me a message with your availability and what you'd like to tackle together.</p>

        <ul>‚ú® Touch designer, Houdini -> for projection mapping and generative art.</ul>
        <ul>ü¶Ä Rust -> all kinds of stuff, do you want a contributor to your project? Or you want to do something with me? Check [here](https://github.com/cyborgdream/cyborgdream.github.io#readme) to learn what I'm up to.</ul>
        <ul>üëπ C++ -> I'm always trying to learn more C++ because the complexity on this language is fractal! I kind of help to organize a meetup about it (that's in Berlin but went online), we can work on that. We can also just learn random stuff together and talk about it, check what [I've been up](https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/c/) to lastly.</ul>
        <ul>üåà Drawing -> I'm a beginner tattoo artist and I still have a long way to go! I know the basics of painting with spray and we can think about mural projects or just tagging random places too. I'm also interested in improving watercolor and general drawing.</ul>
        <ul>üî• Competitive programming -> I'm planning to start this study group on Pyladies Berlin, you're welcome to help me lead (all genders welcome!).</ul>
        <ul>üéº Music -> Music theory, music producing (mainly electronic but also interested in analog jams), djing, foxdot and this kind of shananigans.</ul>
        <ul>üïâ Flow -> Dance, poi, hula-hoop, fire flow, meditation, yoga. Anything flowey, I'm always looking for people to share practices with.</ul>
        <ul>üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Security -> I have this notion that I should know security.</ul>

        <b>Social injustice fighting</b>
        <p>Abortions:<br></p>
        <p>For absurd legal reasons, doctors in Germany are not allowed to post factual information on abortions on their websites. Other websites are allowed to post this information, though. <a href="https://fragdenstaat.de/aktionen/219a/">Frag Den Staat</a> is currently providing resources on the subject in German, English and Turkish.</p>

        <p>If you read this section and were wondering ‚Äúwhy the hell, this is not what I‚Äôm here for?‚Äù: you are entirely correct, but as this information is not allowed to be published where it belongs, it stays here in protest.</p>

        <p>I may expand this section in the future.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Talks</b>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/marimeireles/talks/">Here</a> for an updated list of my talks (auf Portugiesisch und Englisch)</p>
        <p>‚ö†Ô∏è Watch these talks at your own risk, I never watched them after recorded them, so I have no idea how they turned.</p>
    </p>

    <p>Licensing: all of the stuff that's here and doesn't have a license has no license, go wild.</p>
