                  <p>I am seeking opportunities to work with organizations that are uplifting to the world.</p>
                  <p>I've worked as a software engineer for several years now, most of my work was within open-source organizations, and I'm mostly active in the open science ecosystem. I have contributed to projects such as Farama's Petting Zoo (previously OpenAI gym ecosystem), PyScript, Jupyter, PySide, Mozilla Webcompat, Qt, Firefox, whynot, conda-forge, and many others.</p>
                  <p>I am a member of the DISC NumFOCUS steering committee and a collaborator of the Open Knowledge Foundation as an Expert.</p>
                  <p>In the past, I served as a member of the Jupyter committee and as a subject matter expert for NASA, developing a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/new-course-from-nasa-helps-build-open-inclusive-science-community/">course</a> aimed at providing guidance for scientists on practicing open science. I've also taught open science and software classes to graduate students at Harvard through the LSSTC-DSFP program and at <a href="http://github.com/marimeireles/talks">several other</a> conferences, meetups, and groups. I'm also grateful for the Jupyter community having recognized me as a <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/congratulations-distinguished-contributors-bc349fa60d68">distinguished contributor</a>.</p>
                  <p>You can have an overview of my software work by looking at my <a href="https://github.com/marimeireles/">GitHub</a> profile. A more concise list of my previous work experience can be found on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariana-meireles/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
                  <p>I think communicating ideas is very important, so I try to write about software in my personal blog <a href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/">"Do Cyborgs Dream of Bionic Sheep?"</a> and on my <a href="https://medium.com/@mari-meir">Medium</a> page.</p>

                  <a>coordination:</a>
                  <p> I'm a Cooperative AI researcher. I'm interested in improving our understanding of dynamic systems and agents within these environments that are able to develop cooperative interactions. These systems are frequently found at the intersection of complex systems and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</p>
                  <p>The reason why I care about furthering this area of research is because I believe it can directly improve people's lives, be it in increasing cooperation between political and economic agents or in improving coordination among machines and humans.</p>
                  <p>In <a href="https://wbarfuss.github.io/">BarfussLab</a>, I'm modeling agents in repeated general-sum game scenarios using reinforcement learning dynamics. You can have a detailed overview of the research progress by checking <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r5nK_gwiyN51RLmHpYbi4VWZpuH2f22ykvkq4Otpfw0/edit?usp=sharing">this document</a>. Or if you prefer a shorter version you can read the long abstract: <a href="http://marimeireles.com/Navigating-the-Complexity-of-AI-Cooperation.pdf">Navigating the Complexity of AI Cooperation: From Learning Dynamics to Language Models</a>.</p> 
                  <p>I have a <a href="https://techforgoodresearch.substack.com/">research blog</a> where I write about my experiments and I also write about my research in the form of more-or-less structured notes <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/AI-and-coordination-15814d5b41874928b08506a55c92fc61">here</a>.</p>
                  <a>poverty alleviation:</a>
                  <p>I'm currently enrolled in MIT's MicroMasters Program in Data, Economics, and Development Policy because I hope to gain a better understanding on how to be more effective about supporting and developing poverty alleviation policies. I'm interested in ways of decreasing the inequality gap, paying special attention to people living in extreme poverty. I think about <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Global-south-internship-program-6ba5ab15a0f54f2187a55ba0d01aab59?pvs=4" target="_blank">running tech internship projects</a> in the global south while having a fitting <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Pedagogical-ethos-for-kids-impacted-with-poverty-aacad2d96f3c422199524255878b2f07?pvs=4" target="_blank">pedagogical ethos</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Familiar-permaculture-project-Brazil-0277fccccb7740c49cc0845b824e9d10?pvs=4" target="_blank">teaching farmers about permaculture and supporting them with an NGO</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Increasing-internet-access-b377c40a21ba483ebec686afc0a508c5?pvs=4" target="_blank">increasing internet access in the world</a>.</p>
                  <a>open knowledge:</a>
                  <p>I'm driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in the open/libre internet. Liberating knowledge and fostering cultural and scientific development deeply resonates with many of my personal principles and working towards making the digital world more accessible and comfortable for all is a very fulfilling mission to me.</p>
                  <p>My main form of action on this front has been the advocacy of both the ethos and the practice of open source and open science.</p>
                  <a>governance:</a>
                  <p>Increasing interoperability and people's agency in a world of machines and humans. I keep some notes <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Governance-and-open-source-63235d5f677448cfb411db8dbed19fc4">here</a>.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Intentional co-living</b>: I'm starting an intentional community in Berlin. It's loosely centered around hacker-house, music making, scientific and spiritual exploration and just being a huge nerd. If you are interested, please send me an email introducing yourself.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <li><b>Buddhism</b>: I practice Dzogchen Tibetan Buddhism.

I'm part of an <a href="https://aroencyclopaedia.org/shared/text/i/information_in_01_introduction_eng.php">Aro</a> sangha in Berlin and you're welcome to join us if you're interested and respectful. I'm not religious myself, but thankfully this branch is very permissive. I'm also curious to explore other Vajrayana branches.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Books</b>: I love reading and discussing things I learn. Do you want to read together? Check my <a href="https://marimeireles.com/books.html">reading list</a>, maybe we can chill in a cafe or park and share our thoughts after a reading session.</li>

                    <li><b>Light installation and vjing</b>: It's really fun to be the girl taking care of lights at events. I've built my own DMX controller, and I'm somewhat versed in being scrappy with electronics. I also try to be artsy with Touch Designer, I mainly focus on interactive art. Check some of my <a href="https://github.com/marimeireles/touchdesigner-toes/tree/master">toes</a>. Here's a <a href="https://www.behance.net/marianameireles">link</a> for a portfolio I'm building. I'm open for hire and to collaborate in this kind of work.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Drawing</b>: I'm a <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/marimeireles/gallery">beginner tattoo artist</a>. I tattoo myself and friends. To me, this is a very special practice and one of the few things that are sacred to me. I'm open to tattoing new people, if you're interested, send me an email. I also know the basics of painting with spray, and I want to learn more, I would very much like to learn together. I also want to improve in watercolor and drawing, for that I like to go out on small friend dates and paint in the park.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>AI art*</b>: In the past, I've experimented with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hcUHPLk98zN_V89Z0U5nMUhabPjWk05k?userstoinvite=zeynepsatir35%40gmail.com&actionButton=1">GANs</a> and created some <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/marimeireles/gallery/82011542/gan-designs-2021">cool tattoo designs</a>. I've also worked with story telling and agent-based modeling LLMs. Would love to collaborate with artists as a software engineer! For more of my AI projects check my <a href="https://www.behance.net/marianameireles">Behance</a>.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Music</b>: Music theory, music producing (mainly electronic but also interested in analog jams), djing, foxdot(and similar shenanigans). I play the guitar and sing a bit, trying to be better at my Bossa Nova. Also looking for riot grrrls to play some punk rock with.</li>
