        <b><p>Hello beings of the universe, 🖖</p></b>

        <p>My name is Mariana Meireles[she/her]. Welcome to my professional website with sprinkles of personal me. <img src="fairysprinkles.gif" style="height: 30px"></p>

        <p>I'm a software engineer @Anaconda, a subject matter expert on the "Ethos of open science" @NASA and an activist for <a class="link-secondary" href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">ethical open source</a>, animal liberation, leveraging democracy through <a class="link-secondary" href="https://pol.is/home">open democracy practices</a>, combating disinformation in the Web and empowering people to overcome poverty using <a class="link-secondary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school">education</a>, <a class="link-secondary" href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Familiar-permaculture-project-Brazil-0277fccccb7740c49cc0845b824e9d10/">land redistribution coupled with permaculture</a> and local integration techniques and offering OSS opportunities through <a class="link-secondary" href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Global-south-internship-6ba5ab15a0f54f2187a55ba0d01aab59">internships</a> and <a class="link-secondary" href="https://psychonautgirl.space/mentorship.html">mentoring</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm doing lots of Python, Javascript and WASM lately and I'm very excited about the impact we can make on education and the democratization of software through the <a class="link-secondary" href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript">PyScript</a> project. I have an non exhaustive list of <a class="link-secondary" href="https://github.com/cyborgdream/cyborgdream.github.io#readme">tech pet projects</a>. I'm also thinking and researching a lot about OSS and FOSS: the history, the different organizations that emerged out of these social structures and their social implications. Some of this work is under NASA (and will be released to the public later on 2022) but sometimes I add some notes in these <a class="link-secondary" href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Governance-and-open-source-63235d5f677448cfb411db8dbed19fc4">documents</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm a Jupyter distinguished contributor and a member of the Jupyter Widgets steering council, where I sometimes help with outreach, code and general decision making. I'm also part of the NumFOCUS DISC committee where I'm trying to implement an open source internship program similar to Outreachy but mostly focused on the Global South.</p>

        <p>I'm driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in open/libre software and the internet and I love to work with it. The concept of liberating knowledge and nurturing cultural and scientific development deeply resonates with many of my personal goals and working towards making the digital world more accessible and comfortable for all is a very fulfilling mission to me. I'm recently also very interested in forms of governance and organization and how we can use these theories to leverage people out of poverty. Currently trying to combine these two passions. 🙂</p>

        <p>If you're interested in talking to me about any of the things you spot here in this website, please feel free to reach out, check the <a class="link-secondary" href="#community">Community</a> session or <a class="link-secondary" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2EwTIvFCy4P55f32wRWt3kgXRBM2R60sXqWgJ01XiYMsoTe5ioYa6JMeVUjCWeY0_xsEJfoqlf">schedule a call with me</a>.</p>

        <p>If you're a recruiter looking to get in touch with me please check the requisites and have a sit in the <a class="link-secondary" href="https://e7a1xatfr0q.typeform.com/to/ScImy663">waiting room</a>. I'll come talk to you as soon as I can.</p>

        <p>Feel free to look around!</p>

            <p class="card-text terminal-text">After having an incredible experience living in <a class="link-secondary" href="https://wireless-hippie.github.io/martian/">Mars College</a> I decided it doesn't make sense to me to live by myself. I'm looking for a shared community to live with. Do you know of anything? I'll be letting go of my really cheap and cozy apartment in Berlin if you're looking for a place to stay. If you want to get to know me better use a slot from <a class="link-secondary" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2EwTIvFCy4P55f32wRWt3kgXRBM2R60sXqWgJ01XiYMsoTe5ioYa6JMeVUjCWeY0_xsEJfoqlf">here</a>.
            I'm also interested in generative communities in general, if you just want to brainstorm, feel free to get in touch.

                <li><b>C++</b> ➡ I'm always trying to learn more C++ because the complexity on this language is fractal! I kind of help to organize a meetup about it (that's in Berlin but went online), we can work on that. We can also just learn random stuff together and talk about it, check what <a class="link-dark" href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/c/">I've been up to</a> lately.</li>
                <li><b>Drawing</b> ➡ I'm a beginner tattoo artist and I still have a long way to go! I know the basics of painting with spray and we can think about mural projects or just tagging random places too. I also want to improve in watercolor and general drawing.</li>
                <li><b>Music</b> ➡ Music theory, music producing (mainly electronic but also interested in analog jams), djing, foxdot(and similar shananigans). I play the guitar and sing a bit, trying to be better at my Bossa Nova practicing.</li>
                <li><b>Flow</b> ➡ Dance, poi, hula-hoop, fire flow, meditation, yoga. Anything flowey, I'm always looking for people to share these practices with.</li>
                <li><b>Security</b> ➡ Currently I'm wondering about <a class="link-dark" href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Governance-and-open-source-63235d5f677448cfb411db8dbed19fc4">what can be done to minimize disinformation spreading</a>. How can we limit the driving companies in a capitalist context to use technology to help people?</li>
                <li><b>Compilers</b> ➡ I'm interested in how languages started, evolved and are changing. I work with computer languages every day and I'm always thinking about how to make them better to both humans and machine. I'm collecting some ideas <a class="link-dark" href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Experiences-30966e2998e34eb8af0db3830b52ca35">here</a>.</li>

                <li><b>Effective altruism</b> ➡ I don't subscribe to all of their stuff but there are some great ideas and I love the term. Ask me about my dreams and tell me about yours :)</li>

        <p>Abortions:</p>
        <p>For absurd legal reasons, doctors in Germany are not allowed to post factual information on abortions on their websites. Other websites are allowed to post this information, though. <a class="link-dark" href="https://fragdenstaat.de/aktionen/219a/">Frag Den Staat</a> is currently providing resources on the subject in German, English and Turkish.</p>
