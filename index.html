                  <p>Currently, researching coordination under AI lens. Using the concepts drawn from several fields, I’m interested in using my software skills to raise awareness to the issues that crumble our institutions and in ensuring that the development of our moral foundations surpasses our technological development.</p>

                  <p>As an active member of the open-source community, I wear many hats. I engage with NumFOCUS in various capacities: as a distinguished Jupyter contributor, a Jupyter Widgets steering council member, and a participant in the NumFOCUS DISC committee. I'm also a Open Knowledge Foundation Expert, where I offer workshops, deliver talks and mentor people into the open movement. I cooperate with the PyLadies Berlin in the same capacity.

                  <a>coordination:</a>
                  <p>I'm interested in reinforcement learning (RL), agent based modeling, causal inference, cooperative AI, complex systems, game theory and mechanistic interpretability (specially related to RL). I'm curious about modeling scenarios to improve AI/AI and human/AI coordination. I've recently started a <a href="https://techforgoodresearch.substack.com/">research blog</a> where I explain my understanding of these concepts and sometimes come up with new science!</p>
                  <p>I also write about it in the form of some more-or-less structured notes <a href="https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/AI-and-coordination-15814d5b41874928b08506a55c92fc61">here</a>.</p>
                  <a>poverty alleviation:</a>
                  <p>I'm currently enrolled in MIT's MicroMasters Program in Data, Economics, and Development Policy and through that I hope to gain a better understanding on how to better support poverty alleviation. <a href="https://marimeireles.notion.site/Poverty-alleviation-6cc16e6e2e3e49d19ed9112aec79d5cf?pvs=4">Here</a> are some of my ideas, if you'd like to collaborate, please reach out!</p>
                  <a>open knowledge:</a>
                  <p>I'm driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in the open/libre internet. Liberating knowledge and fostering cultural and scientific development deeply resonates with many of my personal principles and working towards making the digital world more accessible and comfortable for all is a very fulfilling mission to me.</p>
                  <p>My main form of action on this front has been the advocacy of both the ethos and the practice of open source and open science. Highlights about my work <a href="https://marimeireles.com/resume-partial.html">here</a>.</p>
                  <a>governance:</a>
                  <p>With the intent of creating resilient communities, I'm interested in driving research that allows for both quantitative and qualitative forms of assessing different kinds of governance systems. Initially, I'm focusing on open source communities and possibly expanding to real-life communities.</p>
                  <p>I have helped shape several open source communities in the past. Currently, I'm helping to write the NumFOCUS Cookbook. In case you're interested/curious, I have some links and comments <a href="https://marimeireles.notion.site/Governance-and-open-source-63235d5f677448cfb411db8dbed19fc4?pvs=4">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>After having an incredible experience living in <a href="https://wireless-hippie.github.io/martian/">Mars College</a>, I've decided for good that "happiness is only real when shared". I'm looking for a commune to live in Berlin - Germany. Let me know if you hear about anything! I'll be letting go of my really cheap and cozy apartment in Berlin if you're looking for a place to stay. If you want to get to know me better, please pick a slot from <a href="https://calendar.app.google/8YGJwftf7mbHwp6t5">here</a>.

                  <p>I found out the way I learn the best is by having the support of a community. Do you want to learn something together? Send me a message! I invite you to take a look at <a href="https://marimeireles.notion.site/ba473e6b20464b63bb6417a3d5e284c0?v=fd6def1276a9491eb766811161ed7ed9&pvs=4">my current list</a> of software projects to see if we have a matching one. But I'm also curious about what you have in mind! Besides writing software, I'm interested in many other things, check the list below!</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Books</b>: I love reading and discussing things I learn. Do you want to read together? Check my <a href="https://marimeireles.com/books.html">reading list</a>, maybe we can chill in a cafe or park and share our thoughts after a reading sesh.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Light installation and vjing</b>: It's really fun to be the girl taking care of lights at events. I've built my own DMX controller, and I'm somewhat versed in being scrappy with electronics. I also try to be artsy with Touch Designer, I mainly focus on interactive art. Check some of my <a href="https://github.com/marimeireles/touchdesigner-toes/tree/master">toes</a>. Here's a link for a portfolio I'm building. I'm open for hire and to collaborate in this kind of work.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Drawing</b>: I'm a <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/marimeireles/gallery">beginner tattoo artist</a>. I tattoo myself and friends. To me, this is a very special practice and one of the few sacred things that are sacred to me. I'm open to tattoing new people, if you're interested, send me an email. I also know the basics of painting with spray, and I want to learn more, I would very much like to learn together. I also want to improve in watercolor and drawing, for that I like to go out on small friend dates and paint in the park.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>AI art*</b>: Back in the day, I've experimented with GANs and created some <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hcUHPLk98zN_V89Z0U5nMUhabPjWk05k?userstoinvite=zeynepsatir35%40gmail.com&actionButton=1">cool tattoo designs</a>. Would love to collaborate with artists interested in doing AI art but lacking the software skills. Here's <a href="https://techforgoodresearch.substack.com/p/yoasi-a-generative-llm-based-universe">an example</a> of a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvXTyeAtUk8/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">collaboration</a>.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Music</b>: Music theory, music producing (mainly electronic but also interested in analog jams), djing, foxdot(and similar shenanigans). I play the guitar and sing a bit, trying to be better at my Bossa Nova practicing. Also looking for riot grrrls to play some punk rock.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Flow</b>: Poi, hula-hoop, fire flow, yoga. Anything flowey, I'm always looking for people to share these practices with.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Buddhism</b>: I practice Tibetan Buddhism. I'm really interested in several facets of it: from meditation to the embodiment of yidams to the beautiful ceremonies and practices. I'm part of an <a href="https://aroencyclopaedia.org/shared/text/i/information_in_01_introduction_eng.php">Aro</a> sangha in Berlin and you're welcome to join us if you're interested and respectful. I'm not religious myself, but thankfully this branch is very permissive. I'm also curious to explore different branches of Vajrayana.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Climbing</b>: I practice every other day in a gym in Berlin. If you're also a climber, let's meet up someday and climb together!</li>
