        <b><p>Hello beings of the universe, 🖖</p></b>

        <p>My name is Mariana Meireles[she/her]. Welcome to my professional website with sprinkles of personal me. <img src="fairysprinkles.gif" style="height: 30px"></p>

        <p>I'm a software engineer @Anaconda, an open source advocate and an activist for kindness. I'm doing lots of Python, Javascript and WASM lately and I'm very excited about the impact we can make on education and the democratization of software through the <a class="link-secondary" href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript">PyScript</a> project. If you're interested in talking to me about any of the things you spot here in this website, please feel free to reach out, check the "Community" session or <a class="link-secondary" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2EwTIvFCy4P55f32wRWt3kgXRBM2R60sXqWgJ01XiYMsoTe5ioYa6JMeVUjCWeY0_xsEJfoqlf">schedule a call with me</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm also a Jupyter distinguished contributor, a member of the Jupyter Widgets steering council and the NumFOCUS DISC committee.</p>

        <p>I'm driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in libre software and the internet and I love to work with it. The concept of liberating knowledge and nurturing cultural and scientific development deeply resonates with many of my personal goals and working towards making the digital world more accessible and comfortable for all is a very fulfilling mission to me.</p>

        <p>Some geeky things I enjoy are: forms of governance and organization, doing art with code(specially when using deeplearning) and thinking about how to solve world problems with the help of technology and social sciences. In case you're interested, <a class="link-secondary" href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">here</a> are some of the things I think about, but not all and I don't necessarily rank them in the same order of importance. I also have an non exhaustive list of <a class="link-secondary" href="https://github.com/cyborgdream/cyborgdream.github.io#readme">tech pet projects</a>.</p>

        <p>If you're a recruiter looking to get in touch with me please check the requisites and have a sit in the <a class="link-secondary" href="https://e7a1xatfr0q.typeform.com/to/ScImy663">waiting room</a>. I'll come talk to you as soon as I can.</p>

        <p>Feel free to look around!</p>

        <a class="link-dark" href="#community"><h3 id="community">Community</h3></a>

        <p>I found out the way I learn the best is by having the support of a community. Do you want to learn something together? Just shoot me a message with your availability and what you'd like to tackle together.</p>

        <ul>* Touch designer, Houdini -> for projection mapping and generative art. Let's <a class="link-secondary" href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/ai/">experiment with GANs</a> and other deeplearning things!</ul>
        <ul>* Rust -> All kinds of stuff, do you want a contributor to your project? Or you want to do something with me? Check <a class="link-dark" href="https://github.com/cyborgdream/cyborgdream.github.io#readme">here</a> to learn what I'm up to.</ul>
        <ul>* C++ -> I'm always trying to learn more C++ because the complexity on this language is fractal! I kind of help to organize a meetup about it (that's in Berlin but went online), we can work on that. We can also just learn random stuff together and talk about it, check what <a class="link-dark" href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/c/">I've been up to</a> lately.</ul>
        <ul>* Drawing -> I'm a beginner tattoo artist and I still have a long way to go! I know the basics of painting with spray and we can think about mural projects or just tagging random places too. I also want to improve in watercolor and general drawing.</ul>
        <ul>* Competitive programming -> I started this study group online through PyLadies, but I feel like the vibe is in meeting IRL. I'll be back in Berlin in July-22 and would love to meet with you. You can find the first class <a class="link-secondary" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z7rUHWAZV1Yl3G_UF4sXPeyMkQ9wEmPGFzrmtOaR620/edit#slide=id.p">here</a>. The idea is to have a gifting community where everyone is a teacher and a student.</ul>
        <ul>* Music -> Music theory, music producing (mainly electronic but also interested in analog jams), djing, foxdot(and similar shananigans).</ul>
        <ul>* Flow -> Dance, poi, hula-hoop, fire flow, meditation, yoga. Anything flowey, I'm always looking for people to share these practices with.</ul>
        <ul>* Security -> I have this notion that I should know security.</ul>
        <ul>* Compilers -> !</ul>
        <ul>* Effective altruism -> I don't subscribe to all of their stuff but there are some great ideas and I love the term. Ask me about my dreams and tell me about yours :)</ul>

        <h3>Social injustice fighting</h3>

        <p>How can you make a difference?</p>

        <ul>* <a class="link-dark" href="https://www.redi-school.org/">ReDI</a>: In response to the refugee crisis the ReDI School was founded: a vocational training program teaching digital skills to migrants and locals. If you're a software engineer, you can help!</ul>

        <ul>* <a class="link-dark" href="https://www.frauenloop.org/">Frauen Loop</a>: FrauenLoop offers a diverse network of women tech professionals who train motivated, women-identified persons in computer programming. They're also looking for teachers.</ul>

        <p>Abortions:</p>
        <p>For absurd legal reasons, doctors in Germany are not allowed to post factual information on abortions on their websites. Other websites are allowed to post this information, though. <a class="link-dark" href="https://fragdenstaat.de/aktionen/219a/">Frag Den Staat</a> is currently providing resources on the subject in German, English and Turkish.</p>
