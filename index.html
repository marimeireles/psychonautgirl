                    <p>With a focus on open source, I’m a governance and coordination issues researcher. Using the concepts drawn from these fields as a base I’m interested in raising awareness to the issues that crumble our institutions and also interested in ensuring that the development of our moral foundations surpass our technological development.</p>

I'm involved with NumFOCUS in a few different ways: as a Jupyter distinguished contributor, a member of the Jupyter Widgets steering council and the NumFOCUS DISC committee. I'm also helping people to develop their software skills at WoCCode, PyLadies Berlin, Open Life Science and at the ReDi project.</p>
                     <p>Earlier this year I consulted as a subject matter expert for NASA and was part of the "Ethos of open science" team, the results of my work should be out at some point in 2023 and they aim to offer guidance to people who want to practice open science.</p>

                    <p>I'm driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in the open/libre internet. Liberating knowledge and fostering cultural and scientific development deeply resonates with many of my personal principles and working towards making the digital world more accessible and comfortable for all is a very fulfilling mission to me.</p>
                    <p>With the intent of creating anti-fragile communities, I'm interested in driving research that allows for both quantitative and qualitative forms of assessing different kinds of governance systems. Initially focusing on open source communities and possibly expanding to real life communities.</p>

I'm looking for a shared community to live with. Do you know of anything? I'll be letting go of my really cheap and cozy apartment in Berlin if you're looking for a place to stay.

                    <p>I found out the way I learn the best is by having the support of a community. Do you want to learn something together? Send me a message! I invite you to take a look at <a href="https://www.notion.so/ba473e6b20464b63bb6417a3d5e284c0?v=fd6def1276a9491eb766811161ed7ed9">my current list</a> of software projects to see if we have a matching one. But I'm also curious about what you have in mind! Besides software I'm interested in many other things, check the list below!</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>AI art, Vjing</b> ➡ I've experimented with GANs and interactive projections before, using Touch Designer, Kinect and DMX lights.</li> 
                      <br>
                      <li><b>Rust</b> ➡ I can't write very complex programs in Rust, but would love to learn. I write about it <a href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/rust/">here</a>. I'm happy to collaborate to your project, specially if they're related with things pointed out on my introduction section.</li> 
                      <br>
                      <li><b>C++</b> ➡ I'm always trying to learn more C++ because the complexity on this language is fractal! I'm part of a woman only work group and you can learn more about it <a href="https://dynamic-cast.github.io/"> here</a>. I post about my work <a href="https://cyborgdream.github.io/tags/cpp/">here</a>.</li> 
                      <br>
                      <li><b>Drawing</b> ➡ I'm a beginner tattoo artist and I still have a long way to go! I know the basics of painting with spray and we can think about mural projects or just tagging random places too. I also want to improve in watercolor and general drawing.</li> 
                      <br>
                      <li><b>Music</b> ➡ Music theory, music producing (mainly electronic but also interested in analog jams), djing, foxdot(and similar shenanigans). I play the guitar and sing a bit, trying to be better at my Bossa Nova practicing.</li> 
                      <br>
                      <li><b>Flow</b> ➡ Dance, poi, hula-hoop, fire flow, meditation, yoga. Anything flowey, I'm always looking for people to share these practices with.</li> 
                      <br>
                      <li><b>Security</b> ➡ Currently I'm wondering about <a href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Governance-and-open-source-63235d5f677448cfb411db8dbed19fc4">what can be done to minimize disinformation spreading</a>. How can we limit the driving companies in a capitalist context to use technology to help people?</li> 
                      <br>
                      <li><b>Compilers</b> ➡ I'm interested in how languages started, evolved and are changing. I work with computer languages every day and I'm always thinking about how to make them better for both humans and machines. I'm collecting some ideas <a href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Experiences-30966e2998e34eb8af0db3830b52ca35">here</a>.</li> 
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      <li><b>Effective altruism</b> ➡ I don't subscribe to all of their stuff but there are some great ideas. Ask me about my dreams and tell me about yours :)</li>
