        <b><p>Hello beings of the universe, 🖖</p></b>

        <p>My name is Mariana Meireles[she/her]. Welcome to my professional website with sprinkles of personal me. <img src="fairysprinkles.gif" style="height: 30px"></p>

        <p>I develop software in contexts that are uplifting to the world. I care about how to effectively employ my efforts in ways that will improve altruistic organisations. With a focus on open source, I’m a governance and coordination issues researcher. Using the concepts drawn from these fields as a base I’m interested in raising awareness to the issues that crumble our institutions and also interested in ensuring that the development of our moral foundations surpass our technological development. In order to achieve these goals I believe the alignment of science, art and magic are essential.</p>

        <p>More specifically I work as an engineer at Anaconda in the <a class="link-secondary" href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript">PyScript</a> project. Earlier this year I consulted as a subject matter expert for NASA and was part of the "Ethos of open science" team. I'm also involved with NumFOCUS in a few different ways: as a Jupyter distinguished contributor, a member of the Jupyter Widgets steering council and the NumFOCUS DISC committee. I'm also helping people to develop their software skills at WoCCode, PyLadies Berlin, Open Life Science and at the ReDi project.</p>

        <p>I support several causes: <a class="link-secondary" href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">ethical open source</a>, <a class="link-secondary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_(book)">animal liberation</a>, leveraging democracy through <a class="link-secondary" href="https://pol.is/home">open democratic practices</a>, <a class="link-secondary" href="https://postmeritocracy.org/">post meritocracy</a> in my engineer work context, <a class="link-secondary" href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Disinformation-9016acd4ac434c239dcfebbdb019671a">combating disinformation</a> in the Web, <a class="link-secondary" href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/">AI alignment</a>, empowering people to overcome poverty using a) <a class="link-secondary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school">non-traditional forms of education</a>, b) <a class="link-secondary" href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Familiar-permaculture-project-Brazil-0277fccccb7740c49cc0845b824e9d10/">land redistribution coupled with permaculture</a> and community building and c) offering OSS opportunities through <a class="link-secondary" href="https://holly-saver-964.notion.site/Global-south-internship-6ba5ab15a0f54f2187a55ba0d01aab59">internships</a> and <a class="link-secondary" href="https://psychonautgirl.space/mentorship.html">mentoring</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in the open/libre internet. Liberating knowledge and nurturing cultural and scientific development deeply resonates with many of my personal principles and working towards making the digital world more accessible and comfortable for all is a very fulfilling mission to me. In this sense, I'm interested in driving research that allows for quantitative forms of assessing different kinds of governance systems. Initially focusing on open source communities and possibly expanding to real life communities.</p>

        <p>If you're interested in talking to me about any of the things you spot here on this website, please feel free to reach out, check the <a class="link-secondary" href="#community">Community</a> session.</p>

        <p>If you're a recruiter looking to get in touch with me for offering me a tech job please answer these <a class="link-secondary" href="https://e7a1xatfr0q.typeform.com/to/ScImy663">two quick questions</a>. If you're looking for research collaborations feel free to contact me directly.</p>

I'm looking for a shared community to live with. Do you know of anything? I'll be letting go of my really cheap and cozy apartment in Berlin if you're looking for a place to stay. If you want to get to know me better use a slot from <a class="link-secondary" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2EwTIvFCy4P55f32wRWt3kgXRBM2R60sXqWgJ01XiYMsoTe5ioYa6JMeVUjCWeY0_xsEJfoqlf">here</a>.
            I'm also interested in generative communities in general, if you just want to brainstorm, feel free to get in touch.
