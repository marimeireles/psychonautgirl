        <b><p>Hello beings of the universe, üëΩüññ</p></b>

        <p>My name is Mariana Meireles[she/her]. I'm not defined by my work, but this is mostly a work related website so that's the reason why it has so many work stuff.</p>

        <p>During the week, I mostly write scientifc software @<a href="https://quantstack.net/">QuantStack</a>. Known as software engineer or developer, but sometimes I'm a bit of code archeologist, librarian and janitor myself. I work mostly with C++ and Python, but Typescript lands are not unknown to me. My team and I are all around the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> ecosystem and we're a consultancy, so if you're interested in our work, feel free to <a href="mailto:marianameireles@quantstack.net">get in touch!</a> ‚ú®</p>

        <p><b>About my tech-tech side:</b> I'm interested in Rust and the design choices made in the language. I'm also curious about deeplearning things and spend part of my free time looking into this stuff. I really like to understand things to their last bit, and reverse engineer all of them until they stop being magical monuments.</p>

        <p><b>About my tech-soul side:</b> I'm a person driven by meaning and I find a lot of significance and love in the idea behind open source and the internet and I love to work with it. It deeply resonates with very different aspects of my personality and I have this hope to make the digital world accessible and comfortable for all.</p>

        <p>When I'm not writing code I'm (ideally) appreciating nature and my beautiful friends, procrastinating on my hobbies (or actually working on them, who knows) and overthinking life.</p>

        <b>Social injustice fighting</b>
        <p>Abortions:<br></p>
        <p>For absurd legal reasons, doctors in Germany are not allowed to post factual information on abortions on their websites. Other websites are allowed to post this information, though. <a href="https://fragdenstaat.de/aktionen/219a/">Frag Den Staat</a> is currently providing resources on the subject in German, English and Turkish.</p>

        <p>If you read this section and were wondering ‚Äúwhy the hell, this is not what I‚Äôm here for?‚Äù: you are entirely correct, but as this information is not allowed to be published where it belongs, it stays here in protest.</p>

        <p>I may expand this section in the future.</p>
    </p>

        <b>Talks</b>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/marimeireles/talks/">Here</a> for an updated list of my talks (auf Portugiesisch und Englisch)</p>
        <p>‚ö†Ô∏è Watch these talks at your own risk, I never watched them after recorded them, so I have no idea how they turned.</p>
    </p>

    <p>Licensing: all of the stuff that's here and doesn't have a license has no license, go wild.</p>
