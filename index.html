        <b>About me</b>
        <p>I work as a scientifc software engineer @<a href="https://quantstack.net/">QuantStack</a>, doing C++ and Python stuff for the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> ecosystem. We're a consultancy, so if you're interested in my work, get in touch! ✨</p>
        <p>I'm very involved with politic matters and that's the main reason why I love working with open source (but the people are also nice).</p>
        <p>Technically speaking, I'm interested in Rust and the design choices made in the language, so I'm trying to absorve a bit of that into my day to day work while also learning the language. I'm also curious about deeplearning things and spend part of my free time looking into this stuff.</p>
        <p>Non-technically speaking, I enjoy spending time with my friends, practicing drawing, writing and playing the guitar. I love to be in touch with nature and am ofetenly told that I'm cringely honest.</p>
        <p>If I triggered your interest and you want to talk to me I'll love it! :) meeting strangers on the internet is my new 2020 acquired hobby.</p>
        <p>I'm available for an asynchronous chat here <a href="mailto:mariana@psychonautgirl.space">mariana@psychonautgirl.space</a> and for a synchronous one <a href="https://gitter.im/marimeireles/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>If by any chance you're in here because of my tattoo stuff, please use either one of these ^. 🐉</p>

        <b>Social injustice fighting</b>
        <p>Abortions:<br></p>
        <p>For absurd legal reasons, doctors in Germany are not allowed to post factual information on abortions on their websites. Other websites are allowed to post this information, though. <a href="https://fragdenstaat.de/aktionen/219a/">Frag Den Staat</a> is currently providing resources on the subject in German, English and Turkish.</p>

        <p>If you read this section and were wondering “why the hell, this is not what I’m here for?”: you are entirely correct, but as this information is not allowed to be published where it belongs, it stays here in protest.</p>

        <p>I may expand this section in the future.</p>
