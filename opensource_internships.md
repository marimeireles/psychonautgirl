I've been thinking a lot about how to be impactful in open source, and something that always come up is the topic of having paid internships for people who are interested in open source.

Reading Nadia Eghb's book is giving me a different, maybe closer to reality perspective on open source.

One thing we need in order to fund these internships is money. I have my (biased) perspective of someone who was introduced in the ecossystem through one of these programs, but also the perspective of an open source contributor with years of experience in onboarding people and building and participating communities and the several isolated data points of friends and colleagues who either agree with my positions or share the same background as me.
Besides individual data I want to create a real source of information to show people that this is not only a kind idea but also an effective action towards the upkeep and expansion of open source.

Regarding research:

1) A good start might be doing some kind of individual, 1:1 overview on how many people keep working with open source, how impactful they are.
    a) Reach out to programs:
        - Outreachy
        - GSOC
        - Rail Girls
    Maybe they've already ran surveys and stuff like this and I can just easily collect this data.
    b) Go after this information myself (or ourselves as other folks might want to chime in on this)
2) It'd be good to understand the open source ecossystem. Tools measuring developers contribution, understanding their backgrounds, etc. will be useful to write a more compreheensible guide on how impactful the people who come out of these programs are.
    a) I'll bring up this topic with NumFOCUS and PyLadies folks. As I think this could be a great partnership + product to NumFOCUS
    b) We need to define what are the questions we want to answer, what are the good measuruments of productivity of a community.
        - A good starting point for that is just reaching out to mantainers and hearing what they have to say, what they would like to measure in their communities and how
    c) For the software itself, we can start with a set of data science functions that:
        - Scrape data from GH
        - Run the analysis on the data and answer these questions
    d) We could also start with just developing forms that we offer to the people we got in touch with so they can run it and send us back the results.
