## open internships

I've been thinking a lot about how to be impactful in open source, and something that always come up is the topic of having paid internships for people who are interested in open source.

One thing we need in order to fund these internships is money. I have my (biased) perspective of someone who was introduced in the ecossystem through one of these programs, but also the perspective of an open source contributor with years of experience in onboarding people and building and participating communities and the several isolated data points of friends and colleagues who either agree with my positions or share the same background as me.
Besides individual data I want to create a real source of information to show people that this is not only a kind idea but also an effective action towards the upkeep and expansion of open source.

Regarding research:

1) A good start might be doing some kind of individual, 1:1 overview on how many people keep working with open source, how impactful they are.
    a) Reach out to programs:
        - Outreachy
        - GSOC
        - Rail Girls
    Maybe they've already ran surveys and stuff like this and I can just easily collect this data.
    b) Go after this information myself (or ourselves as other folks might want to chime in on this)
2) It'd be good to understand the open source ecossystem. Tools measuring developers contribution, understanding their backgrounds, etc. will be useful to write a more compreheensible guide on how impactful the people who come out of these programs are.
    a) I'll bring up this topic with NumFOCUS and PyLadies folks. As I think this could be a great partnership + product to NumFOCUS
    b) We need to define what are the questions we want to answer, what are the good measuruments of productivity of a community.
        - A good starting point for that is just reaching out to mantainers and hearing what they have to say, what they would like to measure in their communities and how
    c) For the software itself, we can start with a set of data science functions that:
        - Scrape data from GH
        - Run the analysis on the data and answer these questions
    d) We could also start with just developing forms that we offer to the people we got in touch with so they can run it and send us back the results.

#### connections

- DISC is working towards something like this? I think something is being layed out. I need to ask on the next meeting that will happen 30.06.22 and update
- In the last PyLadies meeting I've brought up the topic in a very raw form, but the girls seem to be interested in helping the research idea. Maren seems like it'd be happy to hold workshops for the development of this idea. I have to get in touch with Paloma because she did a similar project in saucelabs building a tool to tell how "complete" your open source repository is and this is some way of improving or measuring health in the ecossystem.

## ethos of open source

To improve open source we have to first understand it.

- organizational formats
    - anarchy/socioeconomic perspective
        - Markets Not Capitalism: Individualist Anarchism Against Bosses, Inequality, Corporate Power, and Structural Poverty
        - On Anarchism by Chomsky -> not sure how useful, gives a perspective on the history of anarchism and proletarian organizations, doesn't seem too related. but I should finish it
        - Steal this book -> it's just a historical social commentary on poor counter culture bummie hippies living in the US, but I really like the "criminal" perspective. I should also finish this book and try to write about this high level idea of this kind of persona

- history of open source
    - [stallman's blog](https://stallman.org/) -> the ideas behind free software are absolutely great but also often very impractible. It's a very relevant source of material to understand the purist's perspective and the ideas of the main proponent of this movement.
    - the cathedral and the bazaar -> good analysis on a technical perspective of old open source contribution systems, completely overlooks the social aspects of it, which is both expected for the time and a less relevant subject since everyone was basically one homegeneous blob. Also it's [Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/personal.html)
    - linux foundation's podcast -> I should listen to it
    - open source surveys conducted by github -> they're great, but only go to 2015 or 17? Have to find the links again.
    - Working in public the making and maintenance - Nadia Eghb -> the way she talks about GH is really annoying to me, I'm not sure if it's some personal grudges against orgs (specially Microsoft) or if it's reasonable. She also didn't do a good job at summarizing the ideas on the cathedral and the bazaar (or maybe they're just different from my interpretation? I should look for more input)

#### input from people

several people:

do the code maintanence. put code out there that's dirty or not universally working is bad

v from RSE:

we need to make it easier to already have the data organized/ with metadata. A good example is from  the neuro community - the BIDS standard was developed as a simple organization / metadata format for brain images and associated metadata and a whole suite of tooling was created around it to create and validate BIDS datasets.
