          <p>I've worked as a software engineer with a focus on scientific development for several years. All of this work was within open-source organizations.</p>
          <p>I'm a core contributor to projects such as Jupyter, Firefox, Mamba, Conda Forge, Farama's Zoo, PyScript, PySide, Mozilla Webcompat, Qt, and others.</p>
          <p>Currently I'm affiliated with the Open Knowledge Foundation as an Expert.</p>
          <p>In the past, I served as a member of the Jupyter technical committee, as a member of the DISC NumFOCUS steering committee, as a Max Planck Insitute Open Science Ambassator and as a Subject Matter Expert for NASA, developing a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/new-course-from-nasa-helps-build-open-inclusive-science-community/" target="_blank" className="text-primary hover:underline">course</a> aimed at providing guidance for scientists on practicing open science.</p>
          <p>I've also taught open science and software classes to graduate students at Harvard through the LSSTC-DSFP program and at <a href="http://github.com/marimeireles/talks" target="_blank" className="text-primary hover:underline">several other</a> conferences, meetups, and groups. I'm also grateful for the Jupyter community having recognized me as a <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/congratulations-distinguished-contributors-bc349fa60d68" target="_blank" className="text-primary hover:underline">distinguished contributor</a> in early 2022.</p>

            <ul className="space-y-2 text-xs">
              <li>â€¢ <b>Supper and salon</b>: I host vegan dinners and salons in Berlin. Themes we talked about in the past include "The limits of free speech", "Spirituality and rituals", "Rethinking future socio-economic structures and institutions", "How to be moral", etc. If you are a Berliner or a passer-by and would like to join we welcome first-timers, just send me an email!

              </li>
              <li>â€¢ <b>Buddhism and meditation</b>: I practice Dzogchen Tibetan Buddhism. That said, I was a part of many religious traditions in the past and I enjoy very much learning about all kinds of different cults and spiritual communities. I'm part of an <a href="https://aroencyclopaedia.org/shared/text/i/information_in_01_introduction_eng.php" target="_blank" className="text-primary hover:underline">Aro</a> sangha in Berlin and you're welcome to join us if you're interested and respectful, the sangha is religious.

              <li>â€¢ <b>Literature</b>: I really enjoy learning through reading and exploring new worlds through text. I try to keep an up-to-date <a href="/reading-list.html" target="_blank" className="text-primary hover:underline">reading list</a>, maybe we can chill in a cafe or park and talk about ideas we had after reading together. I also write or post short texts or poems I like <a href="https://lettersfortheevanescents.mataroa.blog/" target="_blank" className="text-primary hover:underline">here</a>.</li>
              <li>â€¢ <b>Multimedia Artist</b>: It's really fun to be the girl taking care of lights at events.

Tattoing is a very special practice to me, something I consider truly sacred and ritualistic. I'm open to tattooing new people, if you're interested, send me an email. I'm looking to get a Sak Yant done, please let me know if you know anyone in Europe or the US that is able to bless it. I tattoo myself and friends. I also know the basics of painting with spray, and I want to learn more, I would very much like to learn together. I also want to improve in watercolor and drawing, for that I like to go out on small friend dates and paint city/landscapes.</li>
              <li>â€¢ <b>AI Art*</b>: In the past, I've experimented with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hcUHPLk98zN_V89Z0U5nMUhabPjWk05k?userstoinvite=zeynepsatir35%40gmail.com&actionButton=1" target="_blank" className="text-primary hover:underline">GANs</a> and created some <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/marimeireles/gallery/82011542/gan-designs-2021" target="_blank" className="text-primary hover:underline">cool tattoo designs</a>. I've also worked with story telling and agent-based modeling LLMs. Would love to collaborate with artists as a software engineer!
