    <p>Hi Richard,</p>
   <p>Sorry to not send you a real letter, but I've been traveling for the whole month of December, it's been very packed to me and I couldn't really make a cool, creative, only-of-its-kind, burner gift for you. Sorry for that. Maybe in the future though!</p>
   <p>So, early on, I decided I'd gift you a book.</p>
   <p>I've took a break from work and for the last two months I've been reading a lot of books. I've came from a somewhat fucked up household and books were both my best escape and my biggest mentors. I hope this one can be a nice mentor to you in the subject of love.</p>
   <p>All about love is a book I picked up because a very smart and dear friend recommended to me. She's struggling with finding and understanding love in many different aspects of her life and she said that revisiting this book always help her.</p>
   <p>As soon as I started the book I found it immediately useful as it early on gives you a definition of what love is. I realized I've never had that because we always treat love as something mythical, undefinable, unreachable, and I don't think it's useful to. Afterwards, the author moves on to analyze her own relationships and I felt invited to analyze mine, under this new framework. It gave me lots of interesting insights about my family, friends and romantic relationships. She then brings a sociological perspective on how the lack of love is responsible for so many problems we face in our society and the importance of community and love to save us in a personal and global level. This part was somewhat depressing for me to read, as all sensible sociological analyses of our time are (because we're fucked), but also very elucidative, so I do recommend it. The last chapters of the book are, in my atheist perspective, dragged into a very annoying and removed from reality religious context and honestly, I skipped the last chapter completely. But the insights on the rest of the book were so valuable to me that I thought it'd be a good gift for you.</p>
   <p>This gift comes from my desire that people become more aware of love, but also the personal desire that it touches you the way it did to me. Hopefully, this book is going to be an insightful conversation between you and various other smart minds that were compiled on it.</p>
   <p>I wish you all the best and all the love,</p>
   <p>Your secret burner ðŸ”¥</p>
